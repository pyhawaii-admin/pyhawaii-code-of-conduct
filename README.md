PyHawaii-code-of-conduct
=====================

This is a "fork" of the 2013 PyCon code of conduct including the staff and attendee guides. 

Thank you to the Python Software Foundation and Python community for releasing an examplar Code of Conduct for use by the
community.

PyHawaii, just like PyCon and the broader Python community, is continuing to evolve daily and we expect that this 
Code of Conduct will evolve, as well.

No changes are final until approved by the PyHawaii leadership and versions in place for a time period/event given year will be clearly marked and the website www.pyhawaii.com will clearly state the revision of the documents posted.
