PyHawaii

The PyHawaii Python User Group is a community of programmers AND soon-to-be programmers focused on educating and mentoring each other in the Python programming language and related technologies with the goal of having fun, growing our skills, and serving the social good. As the Pacificâ€™s Premier Python User Group, we seek to grow the Python programming community in both numbers and diversity. 

We value the participation of each member of the PyHawaii community and want all members to have an enjoyable and fulfilling experience. Accordingly, all members are expected to show respect and courtesy to other members both in online and face-to-face communications channels and throughout any and all PyHawaii activities, meetups, and conferences (collectively called "activity" or "activities" in this document), whether officially sponsored by PyHawaii or not.

To make clear what is expected, all delegates/attendees, speakers, exhibitors, organizers and volunteers at any PyHawaii activity are required to conform to the following Code of Conduct. Organizers will enforce this code throughout any and all activities.

The Short Version
-----------------

PyHawaii is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form.

All communication should be appropriate for a professional audience including people of many different backgrounds. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any activity or communications channel.

Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other members. Behave professionally. Remember that harassment and sexist, racist, or exclusionary jokes are not appropriate for PyHawaii.

Members violating these rules may be asked to leave the PyHawaii community or a particular PyHawaii activity. If attending an actual physical activity, the determination to issue a refund is at the sole discretion of the activity organizers.

Thank you for helping make this a welcoming, friendly community for all.

The Longer Version
------------------

Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

Exhibitors at any activity (i.e. at a physical conference) are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, exhibitors should not use sexualized images, activities, or other material. Booth staff (including volunteers) should not use sexualized clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualized environment.

Be careful in the words that you choose. Remember that sexist, racist, and other exclusionary jokes can be offensive to those around you. Excessive swearing and offensive jokes are not appropriate for PyHawaii.

If a participant engages in behavior that violates this code of conduct, the PyHawaii organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the activity or community (if attending an actual physical activity, the determination to issue a refund is at the sole discretion of the activity organizers.)
